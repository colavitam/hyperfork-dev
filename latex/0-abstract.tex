% !TEX root = top.tex
% above command is so that compilation is always from top.tex

Serverless computing provides a convenient infrastructure for performing
computations in response to certain triggers. In most common severless
deployments, computations are executed in virtual machines. As a result, the
boot time of a virtual machine is a primary component of these services'
latency. We propose an alternative paradigm, in which incoming requests trigger
a flash-clone of an existing, pre-booted virtual machine. Our implementation
HyperFork builds on top of KVM and utilizes the copy-on-write functionality of
the fork system call to improve performance. We demonstrate that HyperFork
improves virtual machine start times by nearly two orders of magnitude while
maintaining throughput. We find that copy-on-write performance penalties are
minimal for real-world workloads and suggest methods for further improving
throughput.
