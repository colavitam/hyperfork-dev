% !TEX root = top.tex
% above command is so that compilation is always from top.tex

A critical performance aspect of serverless computing is the response time of the platform to new requests. One major cause of this latency is the time it takes to spin up a new Virtual Machine image from disk. We propose \emph{HyperFork}, a VM flash cloning mechanism build on KVM, taking advantage of Linux's build-in Copy-on-Write support in the fork() system call. We show that forking a VM outperforms a cold boot by orders of magnitude, while taking an acceptable performance penalty due to Copy-on-Write traps after cloning.
