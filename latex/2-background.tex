\ParagraphQ{Related work or Background}
Several papers will not have a background section (in this case here we have
related work). When we really build on top of prior very complex work this is
needed.

The background section (when needed) includes the necessary prior knowledge to
understand the problem and the solution space. This is the knowledge you build
on, and \textbf{not} the approaches you compare against.
