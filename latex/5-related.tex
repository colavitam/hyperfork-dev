\section{Related Work or Background} \label{sec:related}
Our work in this paper draws concepts from several lines of past research.

\Paragraph{Virtualization Technology} A description of Paravirtualization
(Xen), Binary Translation (Old VMWare), Virtualization Hardware, KVM and QEMU. Keep
it brief and focus on aspects related to current KVM and our Hyperfork
implementation, such as copy-on-write and virtualized hardware extensions. This
is at least 4 or 5 citations.

\Paragraph{Serverless Computing} A description of the general goals of
serverless computing, the various aspects to serverless research, and the
current state of the art industrial offerings. Include things like berkley
serverless stuff, peeking behind curtain, formal models of computation,
Firecracker, and a bunch of AWS/Microsoft/IBM citations for offerings. Again,
brief text, relating mostly to the importance of serverless and interest of
research community. Basically just cite the class reading list.

\Paragraph{Flash Cloning / Coldstart reduction efforts}
Include Potemkin and Snowflock, as well as that short one about caching python
modules.

\Paragraph{VM Live Migration}
Cite some state-of-the-art research / survey, maybe some tools/implementations.
Focus text on explaining difference from flash cloning.
