\section{Conclusion}

We have presented HyperFork, a virtual machine flash-cloning implementation for
serverless computing. Our evaluation demonstrated that HyperFork reduces
virtual machine start time by up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining
end-to-end performance. Furthermore, overall system utilization is drastically
reduced for simultaneous latency-sensitive workloads. Virtual machine cloning
is an effective method for reducing the latency and resource cost of serverless
deployments.
