# README #

This is a repository with a template for paper manuscripts. It include basic formatting, and insight about how to structure a paper.

## VLDB-SIGMOD branch ##

Since we mostly work on SIGMOD/VLDB submissions we have abstracted out the ICDE directives. However, we should always keep the master branch of the template to be the same as the VLDB-SIGMOD template.
